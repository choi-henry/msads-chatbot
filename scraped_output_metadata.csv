1,"Time Series Analysis and ForecastingTime Series Analysis is a science as well as the art of making rational predictions based on previous records. It is widely used in various fields in today’s business settings.Statistical Models for Data ScienceIn a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.Machine Learning IThis course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms. It gives a rigorous methodological foundation in analytical and software tools to successfully undertake projects in Data Science. Students are exposed to concepts of exploratory analyses for uncovering and detecting patterns in multivariate data, hypothesizing and detecting relationships among variables, conducting confirmatory analyses, and building models for predictive and descriptive purposes. It will present predictive modeling in the context of balancing predictive and descriptive accuracies.Machine Learning IIThe objective of this course is three-folds–first, to extend student understanding of predictive modeling with machine learning concepts and methodologies from Machine Learning 1 into the realm of Deep Learning and Generative AI. Second, to develop the ability to apply those concepts and methodologies to diverse practical applications, evaluate the results and recommend the next best action. Third, to discuss and understand state-of-the machine learning and deep learning research and development and their applications.Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics or Big Data and Cloud ComputingData Engineering Platforms teaches effective data engineering—an essential first step in building an analytics-driven competitive advantage in the market.Big Data and Cloud Computing teaches students how to approach big data and large-scale machine learning applications.

2,"Advanced Computer Vision with Deep LearningComputer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses.Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial IntelligenceSince the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.Bayesian Machine Learning with Generative AI ApplicationsThis course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications. Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed. The course begins with an introduction to Bayesian statistical analysis, covering the foundations of Bayesian inference and the application of Bayes’ theorem for statistical inference. We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning. Upon completion, students will be equipped to apply Bayesian methods to a wide range of real-world problems in fields such as engineering, business, finance, and public policy, addressing challenges like missing data or training AI models that are able to say ‘I don’t know’.Data Science for Algorithmic MarketingThis course focuses on marketing science methods and algorithms for undertaking competitive analysis in the digital landscape: market segmentation, mining databases for effective digital marketing, design of new digital and traditional products, forecasting sales and product diffusion, real time product positioning, intra omni-channel optimization and inter omni-channel resource allocation, and pricing across both omni-channel marketing effectiveness and ROI. The course will use a combination of lecture, in-class discussions, group assignments, and a final group project. The course lays special emphasis on algorithms. Hence it draws heavily from the fields of optimization, machine-learning based recommendation systems, association rules, consumer choice models, Bayesian estimation, experimentation and analysis of covariance, advanced visualization techniques for mapping brand perceptions, and analysis of social media data using advanced NLP techniques.Data Visualization TechniquesIn today’s data driven enterprise, data storytelling using effective visualization strategies is an essential skill for analytics practitioners in almost every field to explore and present data. This course focuses on modern data visualization technologies, tools, and techniques to convert raw data into actionable information. Modern data visualization tools are at the forefront of the “self-service analytics” architectures which are decentralizing analytics and breaking down IT bottlenecks for business experts. Moreover, with its foundations rooted in statistics, psychology, and computer science, data visualization shows you how to better understand the data, present clear evidence of your findings to your intended audience and tell engaging data stories through charts and graphics. This course is designed to introduce data visualization as a medium of effective communication using strategic storytelling, and the basis for interactive information dashboards.Digital Marketing Analytics in Theory and PracticeSuccessfully marketing brands today requires a well-balanced blend of art and science. This course introduces students to the science of web analytics while casting a keen eye toward the artful use of numbers found in the digital space. The goal is to provide marketers with the foundation needed to apply data analytics to real-world challenges they confront daily in their professional lives.

This course culminates in hands-on projects, allowing participants to apply theory to practical scenarios.Machine Learning OperationsThe objective of this course is two-fold: first, to understand what Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is and why it is a key component in enterprise production deployment of machine learning projects, and second, to expose students to software engineering, model engineering and state-of-the-art deployment engineering with hands-on platform and tools experience. This course crosses the chasm that separates machine learning projects/experiments and enterprise production deployment. It covers three pillars in MLOps: software engineering such as software architecture, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery and data versioning; model engineering such as AutoML and A/B experimentation; and deployment engineering such as docker containers and model monitoring. The course focuses on best practices in the industry that are critical to enterprise production deployment of machine learning projects. Having completed this course, a student understands the machine learning lifecycle and what it takes to go from ideation to operationalization in an enterprise environment. Furthermore, students get exposure to state-of-the-art MLOps platforms such as allegro, xpresso, Dataiku, LityxIQ, DataRobot, AWS Sagemaker, and technologies such as gitHub, Jenkins, slack, docker, and kubernetes.Natural Language Processing and Cognitive ComputingExtracting actionable insights from unstructured text and designing cognitive applications have become significant areas of application for analytics. Students in this course will learn foundations of natural language processing, including: concept extraction; text summarization and topic modeling; part of speech tagging; named entity recognition; semantic roles and sentiment analysis. For advanced NLP applications, we will focus on feature extraction from unstructured text, including word and paragraph embedding and representing words and paragraphs as vectors. For cognitive analytics section of the course, students will practice designing question answering systems with intent classification, semantic knowledge extraction and reasoning under uncertainty. Students will gain hands-on expertise applying Python for text analysis tasks, as well as practice with multiple IBM Watson services, including: Watson Discovery, Watson Conversation, Watson Natural Language Classification and Watson Natural Language Understanding.Real Time Intelligent SystemsDeveloping end-to-end automation and intelligent systems is now the most advanced area of application for analytics. Building such systems requires proficiency in programming, understanding of computer systems, as well as knowledge of related analytical methodologies, which are the skills that this course aims to teach to students. The course focuses on python and is tailored for students with basic programming knowledge in python. The course is partially project based. During the first three sessions, we will review basic python concepts and then learn more advanced python and the ways to use python to handle large data flows. The later sessions are project based and will focus on developing end-to-end analytical solutions in the following areas: Finance and trading, blockchains and crypto-currencies, image recognition, and video surveillance systems.Reinforcement LearningThis course is an introduction to reinforcement learning, also known as neuro-dynamic programming. It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control.Supply Chain Optimization“Big Data” continues to grow exponentially in our large-scale transactional world where 100,000s of SKUs and millions of customers are interacting with 1:1 offers that include differential pricing, shipping timing/costs and even made to order “custom” product configurations. These consumer behaviors are quickly advancing the availability of new data and techniques within the discipline of Data Science. This elective course will give students the opportunity to apply their skills in data visualization, data mining tools, predictive modeling, and advanced optimization techniques to address Supply Chain challenges. The course focuses on the use of Advanced Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, AI and other Data Science insight and activation tools to automate and optimize the performance of the Supply Chain.

42,"Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before.

Why Sponsor a Capstone Project?

MS in Applied Data Science
The University of Chicago
Capstone Project Timeline Overview
Providing your organization’s data is a critical component of the Capstone process,
and data confidentiality is taken very seriously. By request, students may sign a non-
disclosure agreement (NDA) provided by your company (MS-ADS staff can offer a
template, if needed). The NDA would be between students on the project team and
your organization, as UChicago faculty and staff will not have access to your data.
DATA SECURITY
The MS-Applied Data Science program accepts project proposals year-round for placement at the
 beginning of Spring or Autumn quarters. All proposals must be submitted by mid-February (Spring) or earl
y September (Autumn) using the MS-Applied Data Science Problem Statement Form. The MS-Applied Data Science program accepts proj
ect proposals year-round for placement at the beginning of Spring or Autumn quarters. All proposals must be

The Problem Statement Form is the first encounter students will have with the sponsoring organization. It
 should be complete and concise, and should also be compelling as students will be working on the projec
t for two academic quarters, or around 20 weeks total. 
The Problem Statement Form
Industry partners are vital to the success of this unique Capstone process. While there is no monetary cost
 or contract to sponsor a project, we do consider this a partnership that can be enriching and fulfilling fo
r everyon e involved . Student s ar e provide d wit h expectation s fro m instructors , and , i n turn , Capsto
ne partners should be prepared to provide the following to student teams: 
Sponsor Duties
A statement of the business problem, research
 query, or opportunity for students to address
A description of, and access to, data that
 students will need to respond to the statement
Statement of expectations (deliverables/output)
 from the Capstone project
Dedicated mentor(s) or team to submit the
 problem statement, guide student team, an
d provide general project oversight, along with g
o-to resources and contacts within the business th
at they may interface with during the project
From a recent Capstone partner: 
We’ve had a great time working on the Capstone project this quarter. Despite the challenges, the team
 has made great progress so far! Their dedication to research and problem-solving has been impressive
. We've also learned a great deal from each other along the way! [Founder & CEO] and I are really looki
ng forward to continuing our work together in the Autumn and seeing where our project can go next.
What Makes a “Good” Problem Statement? 
The exciting field of data science is constantly evolving, and students that
 enter  the  MS  in  Applied  Data  Science  program  have  a  wide  variety  o
f interests. Projects that resonate with students can vary by quarter. That sai
d, there are a few recommendations we can offer to make projects compell
ing to all cohorts: 
Prepare a rich data set deliverable within two weeks of the project start
Ensure this is a project of scale ... a team of 3-4 students will spend
 roughly 40 hours per week over 20 weeks on this project
Offer concrete deliverables
Understand that students have varying levels of experience and project
 scoping may require flexibility and being nimble 
Provide direct feedback through mentorship and guidance
Project sponsors are asked to provide dedicated mentor(s) to submit the problem statement, guide student
 teams, and provide general project oversight, along with go-to resources and contacts within the busines
s tha t the y ma y interfac e wit h durin g th e project . Mentor(s ) o r team s shoul d b e prepare d t o mee t wi

MS in Applied Data Science
The University of Chicago
The team will need specific skills to be successful. Where can I state those requirements? 
Please include all required/preferred skills in your Problem Statement Form submission. 
Is it possible that my project won’t get selected? 
Our goal is to offer a large variety of proposals to meet a wide array of student interests. Students
 rank a subset of projects based on problem statements. As there are more options than studen
t teams, not all projects are chosen. If your project is not selected, we may ask to repost your proje
ct the following quarter. 
How can I make sure my project is selected? 
Make your problem statement compelling to students! Proposals that have clear goals, deliverables,
 project outcomes, and data availability are the most enticing to students. 
Submitting a Problem Statement Form
To proceed, will we need a contract with UChicago MS-ADS? 
No, the MS-ADS program does not require a legally binding agreement. We ask that you review the
 guidance shared in this document for expectations.
What about a non-disclosure agreement? 
Students are prepared to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). The NDA would be between
 students on the project team and your organization, as UChicago faculty and staff will not hav
e access to your data. 
Is there a cost associated with being a project sponsor? 
While there is no cost owed to the MS-ADS program, we do expect that sponsors will contribute to
 costs that may include mentorship time, hosting the student team for an in-person meeting, and dat
a sharing and storage/cloud resources. Students may need access to your systems for data, and al
so may need to have you support credits/costs within cloud platforms (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
Can I submit more than one proposal? 
Yes! If your team has the capacity to mentor multiple teams at once, you are welcome to submit
 multiple proposals. 
Before We Get Started ... 
Frequently Asked Questions
05 | 2025

MS in Applied Data Science
The University of Chicago
Can I interview students who may be selected for my team? 
We recommend that “interview” happens in your first meeting with the team. If, at that point, you
ddetermine the partnership will not work, please contact your MS-ADS representative as soon a
s possible to pull the project, and we will reassign the students.
What’s the most important thing for sponsors to be ready for when assigned a team?
DATA! Data receipt and sharing is often our biggest hurdle, and the team cannot work on the project
 until data is provided. Please be prepared to share data with students within two (2) weeks of th
e project start. 
What happens with our Intellectual Property?  
All products of Capstone projects remain the intellectual property of the sponsor.
Who is guiding the team from the MS-ADS program?
Each team works under the guidance of highly accomplished and cited lecturers that include
 UChicago faculty, graduates, and data science community experts that comprise their Capston
e committee: 
Instructor - Dedicated course instructor who provides organization and guides course structure
Advisor - Primarily accountable to advise, oversee, and monitor team progress
Teaching Assistant/Writing Advisor - Provides student teams structural, grammatical, and
 content feedback
How are students matched with projects and teams? 
Capstone teams consist of three or four students. Teams are formed by the program and instructional services based on student responses to an interest/preference survey, and are matched with students who have mutual and complimentary interests. d
Can students come visit our office? 
Absolutely! Site visits are incredibly helpful for students - many of whom have little or no experience
 in an office setting. They would value the time and hands-on experience.
We advise meeting face-to-face at least once as part of onboarding, as this is the best way to help
 students connect to the project on a deeper level. 
If your office is not conducive to hosting a meeting, we encourage you to take advantage of our
 classroom space in NBC Tower in downtown Chicago - simply contact your MS-ADS representativ
e to reserve space and gain access.

MS in Applied Data Science
The University of Chicago
Can sponsors attend the Capstone Showcase? 
Students view sponsor attendance at the Showcase as a huge honor. We hope you can attend! 
Where can we view older projects? 
Watch recordings of earlier Capstone Showcase presentations through our Capstone Library.Watch recordings of earlier Capstone Showcase presentations through our Capstone Library.
Capstone Showcase
Capstone I & II (continued)
How much time will the team spend on my project?
We expect that each student will work 10 hours per week on your project, so you can expect that an
 average size team of four (4) students will spend 40 hours a week, total, roughly equivalent to on
e full time employee. 
How often will we meet with our team? 
At a high level, mentor(s) or teams should be prepared to meet with student groups a minimum of
 seven (7) times throughout the project; see the “Capstone Project Stages” section in this document. 
In general, sponsors meet with teams every other week for an hour check-in/status update, but you
 and your team will schedule a cadence that is appropriate. Some teams are self-sufficient and other
s will want to meet more frequently, and sponsors will generally have a better feel for that appropria
te cadence after a meeting or two.
My team is outstanding, and I’d like to hire one (or more) team members for a summer internship
 or full time position ... is that possible? 
Yes! Capstone projects are an excellent way to engage students in a somewhat long-term interview
 capacity. Please note, students are not permitted to work on projects during work time as Capston
e projects should remain group assignments, as they are a degree requirement.

These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.CoreLeadership and Consulting for Data ScienceLetter GradeProfessional organizations see value in data science when it helps them to achieve their strategic goals, and the current job market likewise rewards data scientists who can use data to advance organizational interests, either as an external consultant or within internal operations teams. Data scientists can become successful (and highly marketable) leaders in today’s professional world, but they require an uncommon skill set: the strategic awareness to align data requirements with business requirements, the technical proficiency to choose a methodology appropriate to each new problem, and the communication skills to both execute the plan as part of a broader team and persuade others of their findings.Core (Choose 1)Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics or Big Data and Cloud ComputingLetter GradeData Engineering Platforms teaches effective data engineering—an essential first step in building an analytics-driven competitive advantage in the market. Big Data and Cloud Computing teaches students how to approach big data and large-scale machine learning applications.

187,"Statistical Models for Data ScienceIn a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.","{'source_url': 'https://www.chicagobooth.edu/mba/joint-degree/mba-ms-applied-data-science', 'retrieved_at': '2025-07-22T20:17:30.567612', 'title': 'MBA/MS in Applied Data Science  | The University of Chicago Booth School of Business', 'section': 'MS in Applied Data Science Courses', 'super_section': 'MBA/MS in Applied Data Science'}"

816,"Time Series Analysis and ForecastingTime Series Analysis is a science as well as the art of making rational predictions based on previous records. It is widely used in various fields in today’s business settings.Statistical Models for Data ScienceIn a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.Machine Learning IThis course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms. It gives a rigorous methodological foundation in analytical and software tools to successfully undertake projects in Data Science.

817,"Advanced Computer Vision with Deep LearningComputer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses.Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial IntelligenceSince the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.Bayesian Machine Learning with Generative AI ApplicationsThis course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications. Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed. The course begins with an introduction to Bayesian statistical analysis, covering the foundations of Bayesian inference and the application of Bayes’ theorem for statistical inference. We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning. Upon completion, students will be equipped to apply Bayesian methods to a wide range of real-world problems in fields such as engineering, business, finance, and public policy, addressing challenges like missing data or training AI models that are able to say ‘I don’t know’.Data Science for Algorithmic MarketingThis course focuses on marketing science methods and algorithms for undertaking competitive analysis in the digital landscape: market segmentation, mining databases for effective digital marketing, design of new digital and traditional products, forecasting sales and product diffusion, real time product positioning, intra omni-channel optimization and inter omni-channel resource allocation, and pricing across both omni-channel marketing effectiveness and ROI. The course will use a combination of lecture, in-class discussions, group assignments, and a final group project. The course lays special emphasis on algorithms.

It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control.Supply Chain Optimization“Big Data” continues to grow exponentially in our large-scale transactional world where 100,000s of SKUs and millions of customers are interacting with 1:1 offers that include differential pricing, shipping timing/costs and even made to order “custom” product configurations.

878,"Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears.","{'source_url': 'https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/masters-programs/online-program/', 'retrieved_at': '2025-07-22T20:17:34.238124', 'title': 'Online Program – DSI', 'section': 'Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence', 'super_section': None}"

983,"Statistical Models for Data ScienceIn a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.","{'source_url': 'https://www.chicagobooth.edu/mba/joint-degree/mba-ms-applied-data-science?sc_lang=en', 'retrieved_at': '2025-07-22T20:17:37.076407', 'title': 'MBA/MS in Applied Data Science  | The University of Chicago Booth School of Business', 'section': 'MS in Applied Data Science Courses', 'super_section': 'MBA/MS in Applied Data Science'}"

1033,"Speaker:Hello, everyone. I am an Admissions Officer at Chicago Booth, and I will be talking to you about our MBA and MS in Applied Data Science joint degree. In this presentation, we'll review the program and its offerings at a high level and talk through the application process, so let's get right into it. We're diving into an incredible opportunity for those with a strong interest in both business strategy and data science, the joint MBA and MS in Applied Data Science degree. If you're someone who sees the power of data in transforming decision-making, but also understands that true success requires a solid grasp of business principles, then this program is designed for you. By combining the analytical rigor of data science with the strategic insights of an MBA, this unique program equips you with a powerful dual perspective, one that is increasingly essential in today's data-driven business landscape. You can expect to develop qualifications for unique roles while working towards this joint degree, including intelligent product management, data science leadership, entrepreneurial founders/CTO, and other roles as companies seek more combined business, AI, and data science acumen for leadership.Speaker:As a Booth student in the joint MBA and MS in Applied Data Science program, you'll have access to the vast resources, experiences, and opportunities offered by both disciplines as well as those unique to the joint degree itself. This includes engaging social experiences, student groups, and competitions, benefits that can inform both your business goals and data science ambitions. For example, Booth hosts over 80 student-led groups spanning professional industries and interests, including the Booth Analytics Club, which supports education, networking, and career preparation for those with a passion for data. Additionally, the Physical Sciences Division is home to a lot of the hard sciences: chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics at UChicago. The University of Chicago is well positioned to be within that environment to articulate and signal to employers the level of depth that our students go into, understanding the theoretical underpinnings of how our models work so that you're going into the marketplace with that deep and rich understanding. As you weigh the options, think about how this dual access could support your short and long-term aspirations in both business and applied data science.Speaker:Now that you have background on what this program is and the resources available at UChicago, let's dive deeper into exactly how this program works. The curriculum in this joint degree is based on the assertion that data is becoming increasingly important, and this program will give students the skill sets needed to understand data in a business environment. The MBA gives students a well-rounded business education grounded in business fundamentals like economic psychology and accounting, and our data science curriculum gives students theoretical and analytical knowledge in data science. And one can't overlook the benefit of completing the curriculum in just two years rather than the three years it would require if you gained the degrees independent of each other. In order to earn an MBA and MS in Applied Data Science, students must complete classes with both Chicago Booth and the Physical Sciences Division. Students will complete roughly 23 courses over the span of two years, including some summer coursework. More information on the exact number of units or credit hours required for this program is available on our website. Both Booth and MS classes will be taken in combination across both years of the program, concluding with a capstone project at the end of the second year. It's important to note that due to the truncated timeline and course requirements, joint degree MBA/MS in Applied Data Science students do not have the same number of pure elective credits as traditional MBA students would. So this is something to consider when applying to the program. In addition, balancing an increased joint degree course load will require students to strategically manage and plan their involvement in both programs and extracurricular activities. Though this may require some additional effort, the long-term benefits of pursuing a joint degree program outweigh these short-term challenges. For maximum flexibility, MS courses are available both online and in person. In-person courses are held at the NBC Tower in downtown Chicago. For the Booth curriculum, most classes will be taken at UChicago's Hyde Park campus.Speaker:Now that you've heard a program overview, let's cover the logistics of applying. Students interested in an MBA/MS in Applied Data Science will apply through the Booth full-time MBA application. You do not need to submit two separate applications. Instead, you will be asked to indicate if you are applying to a joint degree on the Booth application. You would select yes and indicate the MBA/MS in Applied Data Science as your program of interest. You'll be asked to submit all required aspects of a full-time MBA application, which will include a completed application, GMAT or GRE scores, educational transcripts, resume, letters of recommendation, and essays. Then you'll be asked to complete a number of supplemental questions about your interest in applied data science. The application will be reviewed by admissions staff from both Booth and the Applied Data Science Department. Both departments will make their ultimate decision on whether or not you are a fit for the program. If you are not selected as a member of the joint degree cohort, you may indicate if you would like to be considered for admission to the MBA only. If you are not selected as a member of the joint degree cohort and you want to pursue the MS in Applied Data Science independently, you would need to submit a new separate application directly to Applied Data Science. You can apply in any of the three Chicago Booth full-time MBA application rounds, and specific deadlines are posted on our website each year. Please note that applying for the joint degree is only possible at this initial application stage. Once you apply to or matriculate in either the MBA or MS program separately, you won't have the option to switch to the joint degree later. We encourage you to reflect before applying on whether this unique joint degree aligns with your professional goals. We hope this presentation has given you a helpful introduction to the MBA/MS in Applied Data Science at the University of Chicago, and we look forward to reviewing your application.","{'source_url': 'https://www.chicagobooth.edu/mba/full-time/admissions/events/recorded-admissions-events/joint-degree-program#ads-info', 'retrieved_at': '2025-07-22T20:17:37.478138', 'title': 'Joint Degree Program Recorded Admissions Events | The University of Chicago Booth School of Business', 'section': 'MBA/MS In Applied Data Science Information Session', 'super_section': 'Recorded Admissions EventsJoint Degree Programs'}"

1036,"Speaker:Hello everyone. I'm an admissions officer at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, and I'll be talking to you about our MBA and MS in Biomedical Sciences joint degree. In this presentation, we'll review the program and its offerings at a high level and talk through the application process. So let's get right into it. As you think about your graduate education goals, maybe you're someone who always envisioned an MBA, but also has extensive interest in the healthcare space, or maybe a master in science was your plan, but now you're starting to see the value of a management education on top of that. This program seeks to address that intersection of interests for you. Our joint degree with an MBA and MS in Biomedical Sciences is designed for anyone seeking to understand how physicians approach disease processes, how researchers generate clinical evidence, and how that evidence is then applied, or how frameworks are developed for a product to bring it to market and analyze its healthcare outcomes. Anyone with this interest in the intersection between business, medicine, and healthcare may be a good candidate for our joint degree. Additionally, students completing the joint degree are also getting the benefit of earning a degree in two years instead of three, saving you both time and money as you move forward in your career.Speaker:Why do this program at UChicago? I want to make sure to highlight some of the things in addition to our world class curriculum that make the University of Chicago the ideal place for you to pursue your joint degree. First, we have the University of Chicago Healthcare Initiative, which serves as the center of gravity for diverse disciplines that engage in healthcare research at Booth, and it facilitates collaboration with partners across the university. Second, students can access our Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship, which offers a variety of programming focused on biotech, biopharma and more. Finally, there are many different student clubs you can get involved with, including the Booth Healthcare Group, which will play an active role in your career pursuits while at UChicago.Speaker:Now that you have background on what this program is and the resources available at UChicago, let's dive deeper into how exactly this program works. In order to earn an MBA and MS in Biomed, students must complete Booth courses and MS courses, this typically comes to about 14 classes at Booth and six MS courses. The exact details, including the specific number of credits or units needed to complete the program can be found on our website. The majority of classes will be taken on UChicago's Hyde Park campus. The MBA and Biomed joint degree offers a diverse curriculum covering expansive subjects in the business and biomed space. For your MBA curriculum, you will take a series of foundational courses in financial accounting, microeconomics, and statistics, as well as electives you can select in any subject area. It is important to note that the MBA MS joint degree students will have less pure electives than a traditional MBA student to accommodate their Biomed curriculum. Speaking of that Biomed curriculum, your MS classes will be a series of foundational courses in biomedical sciences, Bioethics, and Health Systems, as well as some electives. We tend to see MBA MS students focusing on completing their foundational MBA and Biomed core classes in the first year of the program, and then focus more on electives in the second, although this isn't always the case. You can find more specific information about curriculum requirements on our website. During your time as a joint degree student at UChicago, you will work closely with academic advisors to map out the best curriculum for you. In addition to a strong curriculum, I'm sure you're looking for a joint degree program that supports your career goals. A great benefit of being in the MBA MS in Biomed program at UChicago is that you'll have double the resources including career support. You'll have access to career professionals both at Booth and in the Biological Sciences division. Between student coaches who can help you navigate the recruitment process, to dedicated employer relations teams who facilitate new pathways for students to go through different channels, your career goals will be supported. Our graduates find themselves in a variety of different roles, including working within hospital settings in research or tech careers, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, government policy, and more. Additionally, all of our graduates receive support from Career Services for life, giving you access to our team of professionals at every point in your career.Speaker:Now that you've heard a program overview, let's cover the logistics of applying. Students interested in an MBA MS in Biomed will apply through the Booth full-time MBA application. You do not need to submit two separate applications. Instead, you'll be asked to indicate if you are applying to a joint degree on the Booth application. You would select yes and indicate the MBA and MS in Biomedical Sciences as your program of interest. You'll then be asked to submit all required aspects of a full-time MBA application, which include a completed application, a GMAT or GRE score, education transcripts, a resume, letters of recommendation, and essays. Then you'll be asked to complete a number of supplemental questions about your interest in biomedical sciences. The application will be reviewed by both Booth and Biomedical Sciences admission staff for evaluation. If you are not selected as a member of the joint degree cohort, you may indicate if you would like to be considered for admission to the MBA only. If you are not selected as a member of the joint degree cohort and you want to pursue the MS in Biomedical Sciences independently, you would need to submit a new separate application directly to the Biomedical Sciences program. The full-time MBA application has three rounds of admission every year and the dates usually follow this schedule. You can find exact dates on our website. You may submit an application in any of these three rounds. Please note, you will not be able to apply to the full-time MBA and then decide to apply to the joint degree later. Your interest in the joint degree must be indicated in your one and only joint application. We strongly encourage you to do some self-reflection as you're preparing your application to make sure you are pursuing the correct program for you. We hope this presentation has given you a helpful introduction to the MBA and MS in Biomedical Sciences joint degree at the University of Chicago. We look forward to reviewing your application.","{'source_url': 'https://www.chicagobooth.edu/mba/full-time/admissions/events/recorded-admissions-events/joint-degree-program#ads-info', 'retrieved_at': '2025-07-22T20:17:37.478138', 'title': 'Joint Degree Program Recorded Admissions Events | The University of Chicago Booth School of Business', 'section': 'MBA/MS In Biomedical Sciences Information Session', 'super_section': 'Recorded Admissions EventsJoint Degree Programs'}"

1039,"Speaker:Hello, everyone. I'm an Admissions Officer at Chicago Booth, and I will be talking to you about our JD/MBA joint degree. In this presentation, we'll review the program and its offerings at a high level and talk through the application process. Whether you are just starting to think about graduate school or you already know you'd like to apply, we'll cover information that's helpful for you, so let's get right into it. If you're interested in the intersection of business and law, there are many benefits to pursuing a joint degree. Combining the tangible business skills you'll gain at Booth with the legal knowledge acquired at UChicago Law opens doors across various career paths regardless of your ultimate aspirations. This JD/MBA credential can prepare you for a career in law with a strong business foundation, corporate counsel roles, or even entrepreneurship with a valuable legal perspective. Many students come to grad school looking to accelerate their careers or make a leap to the next step, and a JD/MBA can be the degree you need to reach your goals.Speaker:Why is the University of Chicago the best place for you to get your JD/MBA? First, we offer both a four-year program and a three-year accelerated program. Both are vastly shorter than pursuing both of these degrees separately, saving you both time and investment. Additionally, UChicago is world renowned for our academic rigor and ability to give our students the skills and toolkits needed to navigate different situations, thrive in ambiguity, and apply theoretical knowledge with real-world technical situations. Students have access to the resources provided by both UChicago Law and Booth, and become part of a world-class network of alumni from both institutions. You aren't just joining a business program and taking law classes, or vice versa. You are joining two robust communities and programs that are set up to help you if you'd like to take a traditional law career path, pursue a business opportunity, or a career spanning both following graduation. Now let's dive deeper into exactly how the JD/MBA program at UChicago works.Speaker:As I mentioned, we have both a four-year traditional and three-year accelerated JD/MBA option. I'd like to provide brief overviews of the schedule for both program options. In the three-year JD/MBA, you start at the law school and complete all of your first year law requirements. During your first summer, you pursue a law or business internship and begin your Booth curriculum with two summer business courses. In your second year, you continue with your Booth curriculum, including several business classes that will be taught by Booth faculty members and feature MBA content, but be physically taught at the Law school. Over the second summer, you complete another internship based on your career goals before completing your law requirements in your third academic year. Due to the accelerated timeline and course requirements, our three-year JD/MBAs do not have the same level of flexibility in choosing their courses as a traditional MBA or JD student would. The four-year JD/MBA is largely similar to the three-year program, but spread out through an additional year of study. Like the three-year program, you begin with the first year Law curriculum. The second and third year gives you the flexibility to chart your academic course through the degree with more options because of the increased timeframe. Within those two years, you'll complete one year at the law school and one year at Booth. The final year is predominantly at the law school. Like the three-year program, during your summers, you will pursue internships aligned with your career goals, whether those be in law or business. Students in the four-year program are not required to take summer classes. Sample schedules of both tracks can be found on our website. The specific curriculum requirements for a JD/MBA vary slightly depending on the track you choose, but regardless, all students will complete a mix of Booth coursework and UChicago Law coursework. More details on the exact number of units or credits required can be found on our website. In Law courses, students will gain a legal foundation in the concepts of statutory interpretation, judicial decision-making, and legal research before expanding into an interdisciplinary exploration of how law intersects business. At Booth, students will gain a management education that is grounded in the core principles with a multidisciplinary approach to problem solving. You will evaluate problems through the fundamentals underlying business and accounting, economics, psychology, sociology, and statistics.Speaker:Now that you have a better understanding of the program itself, let's transition to talking about the JD/MBA application process, which is a little different from a traditional MBA or JD route. For both the three-year accelerated and four-year option, it is a two-step process. First, you will submit a single joint application found on the Booth website. This will ask you to include all traditional elements of an MBA or JD application, including a test score, academic transcripts, essays, including a personal statement, and letters of recommendation. We'll talk a bit more about each of those in a minute. Second, you need to complete the JD/MBA form and submit your official academic transcripts on lsac.org. This is a separate website from the main application portal. Detailed instructions are available in our application. So now let's take a look at the application elements I mentioned. For test scores, we will accept a GMAT, GRE, or LSAT score, and there is no preference on which exam you are submitting. For your resume, we'll ask you to submit a one to two-page resume that introduces us to your work experience. This can include experience outside of your professional life, like volunteer work, but try and make it as comprehensive as possible so we can get a great understanding of your background. Additionally, two letters of recommendation are required. More details on who applicants typically ask can be found on our website. Your academic transcripts will also be submitted with your application and with the form on lsac.org. All of your undergraduate and graduate level transcripts must be submitted. Admissions officers will look closely at the classes you've taken as well as the grades you've received to help make their final determination. International students will be asked to submit a test score for English language proficiency. Some international students may be eligible for a waiver, and you can find out more information on our website. You will also be asked to answer a series of essay questions. These will likely address your short and long-term goals, as well as why you would like to pursue a JD/MBA. The application will also ask you to introduce yourself through a personal statement. Finally, interviews will be conducted by invitation only and you are not guaranteed an interview. If you are invited, you will speak to an interviewer from both the Law school and Booth. More information will be provided if you receive an invitation.Speaker:It is important to point out that the JD/MBA application includes a question that asks you if you'd like to be considered for just the JD or just the MBA should you not be admitted to the joint degree. If you select yes for either program, your application will be moved to consideration for the individual program of your choice if you are not selected for the joint degree. Finally, JD/MBA applicants must apply in one of our two rounds of JD/MBA admission. Those deadlines traditionally follow this schedule. You can visit our website for specific dates. We hope this presentation has given you a helpful introduction to the JD/MBA program at the University of Chicago. We look forward to reviewing your application.","{'source_url': 'https://www.chicagobooth.edu/mba/full-time/admissions/events/recorded-admissions-events/joint-degree-program#ads-info', 'retrieved_at': '2025-07-22T20:17:37.478138', 'title': 'Joint Degree Program Recorded Admissions Events | The University of Chicago Booth School of Business', 'section': 'JD/MBA Information Session', 'super_section': 'Recorded Admissions EventsJoint Degree Programs'}"

The structure of the Computer Science Program combines theoretical learning with practical application, ensuring that students are not only equipped with a comprehensive knowledge base, but are also able to step immediately into their careers with confidence and industry know-how. You can utilize career services teams from Booth and the Master's Program in Computer Science to access comprehensive support and career guidance resources as you develop the foundational skills you will build your career with. I also wanted to highlight some of our student life components. We have over 80 student clubs at Booth that students can get involved in. These range from professional groups to social groups and different affinity groups. To highlight a few, the Booth Technology Group is extremely active within the MPCS/MBA Joint Degree. They host tech conferences and have hosted speakers from places like Microsoft, Amazon, and DoorDash. They've also hosted Virtual Tech Treks with Booth alumni from companies like Meta, Walmart, Cisco, and more. You can also access the Booth Artificial Intelligence Group that has garnered a massive amount of interest, hosting their own string of events every year. Within these groups, students have access to get involved with the student community and to take advantage of a plethora of learning, development and networking opportunities. You will also have access to the Computer Science Program student organizations, including Uncommon Hacks, a group that runs hackathons throughout the year, and Asynchronous Anonymous, where students host different workshop events. By enrolling in the MBA/MPCS Joint Degree Program, you will have access to both the Booth and Computer Science Program communities, which you can take advantage of within your networking, classes and extracurricular involvement.Speaker:Now that you have background on what this program offers, let's dive deeper into exactly how it works. The MBA/MPCS Program is designed to be completed in six quarters across two years. Students must complete Booth courses and MPCS courses throughout both years of the program. The exact details, including the specific number of credits or units needed to complete the program can be found on our website. The program will begin in the autumn quarter, although in some circumstances, students could take prerequisite courses in the summer before the start of the program. The MPCS courses are taught in the evening at The John Crerar Library on UChicago's Hyde Park Campus. MBA coursework will primarily be taught during the day at the Harper Center in Hyde Park. As we've discussed, the MBA/MPCS offers a professionally focused program with a curated pathway through our curriculum that caters to your career goals. Your MPCS classes will cover a foundational knowledge base of data science, data analytics, programming, algorithm development, systems, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and more. A comprehensive and evolving learning environment is important because we want what you learn to be relevant to you and to meet ever-changing industry needs. Our faculty advisors are able to sit down with you early on in the program to talk about what your goals are and what courses can help you to achieve them. You will be able to engage in practical projects and industry collaborations throughout your time in this program. We have specific dedicated career staff who will help you through the career search post-graduation as well. These career experts will be available to talk to you about preparing for those technical interviews, technical exams that you may go through in a job interview process, and even more practical applications of professional development.Speaker:Let's transition to talking about the application process. In order to apply for the MPCS/MBA Joint Degree Program, you will apply through Booth's full-time MBA application. You will not submit separate applications to both Booth and the MPCS. There's a question on the program page of the application that asks, are you applying to just the MBA or to a joint degree program? You'll select a joint degree program, select the MBA/MPCS as your program of interest, and that will populate the Supplemental MPCS portion of the application. The MBA/MPCS Joint Degree does not require a background in Computer Science, so if you don't have that experience, there are many other things that you can highlight. Maybe you have taken some upper-level math courses in your undergraduate degree program, or maybe you work in a technically challenging role right now. Within the supplement, you'll be able to highlight these experiences in relation to your interest in an MPCS degree. The application will also ask you to submit your resume, academic transcripts, GMAT or GRE score, essay responses, two letters of recommendation an English language assessment for non-native speaking applicants, and an application fee. We take a holistic approach during our review, meaning we consider every component of your application in our evaluation. We are hoping to see indications of a strong quantitative and technical aptitude through each of these application elements. This allows us to assess your potential for success in our program. The Booth application process goes through three rounds of admission with the first deadline usually occurring around mid-September, the second in early January, and the third and final in early April. The joint degree application also follows not only the Booth application structure, but the application timeline as well, so you can apply in any of our three rounds in order to start in the following fall. MBA and MPCS applications will be reviewed by the Admissions Officers from both programs. If you are not selected as a member of the joint degree cohort, you may indicate if you would like to be considered for admission to the MBA only. The decision on your joint degree application will not affect the individual decision Booth may make on your MBA candidacy, however, if you are not admitted to the joint degree cohort and you want to pursue the Master's Program in Computer Science independently, you would need to submit a new separate application directly to the MPCS.Speaker:It is also important to note that applicants will not be able to apply to the full-time MBA initially and then to the MPCS Joint Degree later, or vice versa. We strongly encourage you to look at this process as a time of self-reflection and thinking about what your graduate education might look like. Take the time to consider if this joint degree is the best possible path for you and your career aspirations. If you are looking to cultivate your future career with a forward-thinking degree that meets you at the intersection of business and technology, our MBA/MPCS Program can help you reach your goals. We hope this presentation has given you a helpful introduction to the MBA/MPCS Joint Degree at the University of Chicago. We look forward to reviewing your application.","{'source_url': 'https://www.chicagobooth.edu/mba/full-time/admissions/events/recorded-admissions-events/joint-degree-program#ads-info', 'retrieved_at': '2025-07-22T20:17:37.478138', 'title': 'Joint Degree Program Recorded Admissions Events | The University of Chicago Booth School of Business', 'section': 'MBA/Master Program in Computer Science Information Session', 'super_section': 'Recorded Admissions EventsJoint Degree Programs'}"

Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation.","{'source_url': 'https://www.chicagobooth.edu/mba/joint-degree/mba-ms-applied-data-science?sc_lang=en', 'retrieved_at': '2025-07-22T20:17:37.844973', 'title': 'MBA/MS in Applied Data Science  | The University of Chicago Booth School of Business', 'section': 'MS in Applied Data Science Courses', 'super_section': 'MBA/MS in Applied Data Science'}"

Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions.
